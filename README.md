Transforming the management of patient data at a Mental Health Clinic, this initiative introduced a centralized electronic database, replacing traditional paper forms and Excel spreadsheets. The transition to digital records, facilitated by an Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) process, enhanced operational efficiency and minimized errors. Furthermore, the implementation of interactive Power BI dashboards provided real-time insights into patient data, enabling informed decision-making and streamlining operational processes.
